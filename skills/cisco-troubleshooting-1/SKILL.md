# Cisco Network Troubleshooting Skill

This skill implements the **Structured Troubleshooting Process** from Cisco curriculum, avoiding haphazard "shoot from the hip" attempts. Every fault follows a rigorous four-phase lifecycle that ensures systematic problem resolution and comprehensive documentation.

## Core Principles

- **Systematic approach**: Never guess or randomly try commands
- **Evidence-based**: Every hypothesis must be tested and validated
- **Documented process**: Maintain a clear audit trail of all actions
- **Methodology-driven**: Select the right approach for each problem type
- **Verification-focused**: Confirm resolution before closing the incident

---

## Phase I: Problem Definition & Assessment

**Objective**: Transform vague symptoms into a precise technical problem statement.

### Process

1. **Gather Initial Report**
   - What are the exact symptoms? (e.g., "cannot access web server" not "network is broken")
   - Who is affected? (specific users, devices, subnets)
   - When did it start? (timeline, recent changes)
   - What changed recently? (configurations, hardware, software)

2. **Clarify Ambiguities**
   - Ask specific questions to eliminate vague descriptions
   - Example transformations:
     - "The network is down" → "User A at 10.1.1.10 cannot ping the default gateway 10.1.1.1"
     - "Internet is slow" → "HTTP downloads from external servers take >30 seconds vs. normal 2 seconds"
     - "Can't connect" → "SSH connection to router 192.168.1.1 times out after 3 attempts"

3. **Document Problem Statement**
   Create a clear, technical problem statement including:
   - **Symptoms**: Specific observable failures
   - **Scope**: Affected devices/users/services
   - **Timeline**: When it started, when it occurs
   - **Baseline**: What normal behavior looks like

**Output**: A crisp problem statement ready for methodological analysis.

---

## Phase II: Methodology Selection

**Objective**: Choose the optimal troubleshooting approach based on problem characteristics.

### Decision Framework

Analyze the problem statement and select from these five methodologies:

#### 1. **Top-Down Approach**
**When to use**:
- Problem appears to be at the application layer (Layer 7)
- Application-specific symptoms (DNS failures, web server errors, email issues)
- Lower layers are confirmed working

**Process**:
- Start at OSI Layer 7 (Application)
- Work down through the stack: Application → Presentation → Session → Transport → Network → Data Link → Physical
- Example sequence: Check web server logs → Verify HTTP service → Check TCP ports → Verify IP connectivity → Check switching → Verify cables

**Best for**: "Users can ping the server but can't access the website"

---

#### 2. **Bottom-Up Approach**
**When to use**:
- Suspected physical layer failure
- "Cable unplugged" scenarios
- New hardware installation issues
- Total connectivity loss

**Process**:
- Start at OSI Layer 1 (Physical)
- Work up through the stack: Physical → Data Link → Network → Transport → Session → Presentation → Application
- Example sequence: Check cable connection → Verify interface status → Check switch port → Verify VLAN → Test IP connectivity → Verify routing

**Best for**: "The new switch installation isn't working" or "Link light is off"

---

#### 3. **Divide and Conquer** (Most Versatile)
**When to use**:
- Unknown problem location
- Complex multi-layer issues
- Default choice when other methods aren't clearly indicated

**Process**:
- Start at OSI Layer 3 (Network layer)
- Test with `ping` or similar network-layer tool
- **If ping succeeds**: Problem is in upper layers (Transport/Session/Presentation/Application)
- **If ping fails**: Problem is in lower layers (Physical/Data Link/Network)
- Continue dividing the remaining layers until root cause is found

**Example diagnostic tree**:
```
ping target
├─ SUCCESS → Check upper layers
│  ├─ Telnet/SSH port test
│  ├─ Application logs
│  └─ Service status
└─ FAIL → Check lower layers
   ├─ Check routing table
   ├─ Check ARP cache
   ├─ Check interface status
   └─ Check physical connectivity
```

**Best for**: "User can't reach the file server" (unclear which layer is failing)

---

#### 4. **Follow the Traffic Path**
**When to use**:
- Multi-hop routing issues
- WAN connectivity problems
- Need to find exact failure point in packet path
- ACL or firewall blocking suspected

**Process**:
- Trace the packet path hop-by-hop from source to destination
- Use `traceroute` or `tracert` to identify where packets stop
- Examine each device in the path for:
  - Routing table entries
  - Interface status
  - ACLs blocking traffic
  - NAT translations
  - QoS policies

**Example**:
```
User PC → Switch A → Router A → WAN Link → Router B → Switch B → Server

1. Verify User PC can reach Switch A (default gateway)
2. Verify Router A has route to destination
3. Check WAN link status
4. Verify Router B receives packets
5. Check ACLs on Router B
6. Verify Server is reachable from Switch B
```

**Best for**: "Remote office can't access headquarters resources"

---

#### 5. **Compare Configurations**
**When to use**:
- One device works, another doesn't (similar setup)
- Suspected misconfiguration
- After configuration changes
- Standardization/compliance checking

**Process**:
- Identify a working reference device (baseline)
- Compare configurations section by section:
  - Interface configurations
  - Routing protocol settings
  - ACLs and security policies
  - VLANs and trunking
  - QoS and service policies
- Flag discrepancies for investigation
- Use tools: `show running-config`, `show startup-config`, config diff utilities

**Best for**: "Router A works fine, but Router B with identical setup doesn't work"

---

### Selection Logic

Use this decision tree to select methodology:

```
Is this a physical problem (cable, power, hardware)?
├─ YES → Bottom-Up
└─ NO → Continue

Is there a working device to compare?
├─ YES → Compare Configurations
└─ NO → Continue

Is this clearly an application problem (DNS, HTTP, etc.)?
├─ YES → Top-Down
└─ NO → Continue

Is this a multi-hop routing/path issue?
├─ YES → Follow the Traffic Path
└─ NO → Divide and Conquer (default)
```

**Document your choice**: Always state which methodology was selected and why.

---

## Phase III: Diagnostic Execution

**Objective**: Systematically gather evidence, test hypotheses, and isolate the root cause.

### Step 1: Gather Information

Collect data using appropriate tools:

#### CLI Commands (Cisco IOS)
```
# Interface status and statistics
show interfaces [interface-id]
show ip interface brief
show interfaces status
show interfaces trunk

# Routing and Layer 3
show ip route
show ip protocols
show ip ospf neighbor
show ip eigrp neighbors
show ip bgp summary

# Layer 2 switching
show mac address-table
show vlan brief
show spanning-tree
show cdp neighbors detail

# Access Control and Security
show ip access-lists
show access-lists
show ip nat translations

# Hardware and system
show version
show inventory
show environment
show logging

# Debugging (use with caution)
debug ip routing
debug ip packet
debug eigrp packets
```

#### Network Tools
- **ping**: Test Layer 3 connectivity
- **traceroute**: Identify path and failure point
- **telnet/SSH**: Test Layer 4 (Transport) connectivity to specific ports
- **nslookup/dig**: Test DNS resolution
- **NetFlow/IPFIX**: Analyze traffic patterns
- **SNMP**: Monitor device health and statistics
- **Packet capture**: Wireshark/tcpdump for deep analysis

### Step 2: Establish Baseline Behavior

Compare current state against normal operation:

| Component | Normal Behavior | Current Observation | Status |
|-----------|----------------|---------------------|--------|
| Interface Gi0/1 | Up/Up | Up/Up | ✓ OK |
| OSPF neighbor | Full state | Down | ✗ FAULT |
| Routing table | 15 routes | 15 routes | ✓ OK |
| ACL hits | ~1000/min | 0/min | ✗ SUSPICIOUS |

### Step 3: Eliminate Valid Causes

Systematically rule out functioning components:

**Example process**:
1. ✓ Physical layer: Interface shows "up/up", cable test passed
2. ✓ Data Link layer: CDP neighbors visible, MAC address learned
3. ✗ Network layer: No route to destination subnet
4. Investigation needed: Why is route missing?

### Step 4: Hypothesize and Test

Develop testable hypotheses and verify each:

**Hypothesis template**:
- **Hypothesis**: "Route is missing because OSPF neighbor relationship failed"
- **Test**: Check `show ip ospf neighbor` for neighbor state
- **Expected result**: Neighbor should be in FULL state
- **Actual result**: Neighbor shows INIT state (stuck)
- **Conclusion**: OSPF Hello mismatch or authentication failure

**Iterate through hypotheses**:
1. First hypothesis → Test → Result
2. If false, develop next hypothesis
3. If true, verify by fixing and retesting
4. Continue until root cause is confirmed

### Step 5: Implement Workaround (if needed)

If immediate fix isn't possible:
- Document temporary workaround
- Note limitations and risks
- Schedule permanent resolution
- Communicate to stakeholders

Example: "Static route added temporarily while investigating OSPF issue"

### Step 6: Verify Resolution

Test the specific symptoms from Phase I:
- Can user now access the server?
- Does ping succeed?
- Are error messages gone?
- Is performance back to baseline?

**Don't assume**: Test everything explicitly.

---

## Phase IV: Resolution & Reporting

**Objective**: Document the complete troubleshooting process for knowledge management and future reference.

### Resolution Report Structure

Generate a comprehensive report containing:

#### 1. **Incident Summary**
```
Incident ID: [INC-2024-0123]
Reported: [2024-02-08 09:15 PST]
Reported by: [User: john.doe@company.com]
Severity: [High - Production Impact]

Problem Statement:
Users in Building A (subnet 10.20.30.0/24) cannot access the file server 
at 10.10.10.5. Ping to server times out. Started after maintenance window 
on 2024-02-08 at 07:00 PST.
```

#### 2. **Methodology Applied**
```
Selected Approach: Divide and Conquer

Rationale:
- Unknown whether issue is upper or lower layer
- Started with Layer 3 ping test to determine direction
- Ping failed, indicating lower layer issue
- Proceeded to check routing and Layer 2
```

#### 3. **Diagnostic Log**

Chronological record of all investigations:

```
[09:20] Initial ping test from 10.20.30.10 to 10.10.10.5 - FAILED
        
[09:22] Checked user workstation default gateway
        Command: ipconfig /all
        Result: Gateway 10.20.30.1 configured, reachable
        
[09:25] Tested ping from Router A (10.20.30.1) to 10.10.10.5 - FAILED
        This confirms issue is beyond the local subnet
        
[09:27] Checked routing table on Router A
        Command: show ip route | include 10.10.10.0
        Result: No route to 10.10.10.0/24 found
        Hypothesis: Missing route or routing protocol failure
        
[09:30] Checked OSPF neighbor status
        Command: show ip ospf neighbor
        Result: Neighbor 10.1.1.2 in INIT state (should be FULL)
        Hypothesis: OSPF Hello parameter mismatch
        
[09:33] Verified OSPF configuration
        Command: show ip ospf interface GigabitEthernet0/1
        Result: Hello interval = 10 seconds (standard)
               Dead interval = 40 seconds (standard)
        
[09:35] Checked neighbor router configuration (via console)
        Command: show ip ospf interface GigabitEthernet0/0
        Result: Hello interval = 20 seconds (NON-STANDARD)
               Dead interval = 80 seconds (NON-STANDARD)
        ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED: Hello/Dead timer mismatch
        
[09:40] Verified no OSPF authentication mismatch
        Command: show ip ospf interface | include auth
        Result: No authentication configured on either end - OK
```

#### 4. **Root Cause Analysis**

```
Root Cause:
OSPF neighbor relationship between Router A (10.20.30.1) and Router B 
(10.1.1.2) failed to establish due to Hello/Dead timer mismatch.

Technical Details:
- Router A: Hello=10s, Dead=40s (default)
- Router B: Hello=20s, Dead=80s (non-standard)
- OSPF requires matching timers for adjacency formation
- Timers were changed during last night's maintenance but not 
  synchronized between both routers

Impact:
- Route to 10.10.10.0/24 not learned via OSPF
- No alternative path available
- All traffic from Building A to file server failed
```

#### 5. **Resolution Action**

```
Configuration Change Implemented:

Router B Configuration:
-----------------------
Router-B# configure terminal
Router-B(config)# interface GigabitEthernet0/0
Router-B(config-if)# ip ospf hello-interval 10
Router-B(config-if)# ip ospf dead-interval 40
Router-B(config-if)# end
Router-B# write memory

Verification:
------------
Router-B# show ip ospf neighbor
Neighbor ID     Pri   State        Dead Time   Address
10.20.30.1      1     FULL/DR      00:00:35    10.1.1.1

Router-A# show ip route 10.10.10.0
Routing entry for 10.10.10.0/24
  Known via "ospf 1", distance 110, metric 20
  Last update from 10.1.1.2, 00:02:15 ago
  Routing Descriptor Blocks:
  * 10.1.1.2, from 10.10.10.5, 00:02:15 ago, via GigabitEthernet0/1
```

#### 6. **Testing and Verification**

```
Post-Resolution Testing:

Test 1: Ping from user workstation
-------
C:\> ping 10.10.10.5
Reply from 10.10.10.5: bytes=32 time=2ms TTL=62
Reply from 10.10.10.5: bytes=32 time=1ms TTL=62
Status: SUCCESS ✓

Test 2: File server access test
-------
User: john.doe successfully accessed \\fileserver\shared
Status: SUCCESS ✓

Test 3: OSPF neighbor stability
-------
Monitored for 10 minutes - neighbor remains in FULL state
Status: STABLE ✓

Test 4: Route presence verification
-------
Router-A# show ip route 10.10.10.0/24
Route present via OSPF with metric 20
Status: SUCCESS ✓

All symptoms from initial problem report resolved.
```

#### 7. **Lessons Learned and Recommendations**

```
Immediate Actions Taken:
1. ✓ OSPF timers synchronized across all routers in datacenter

## Critical Success Factors

### 1. **Stay Methodical**
- Never skip steps even if you "think" you know the answer
- Document everything as you go
- Don't let urgency force you into guessing

### 2. **Use the Right Tools**
- `show` commands are non-invasive - use liberally
- `debug` commands can impact performance - use cautiously
- Packet captures provide definitive evidence

### 3. **Think Like a Packet**
- Follow the packet's journey through the network
- Consider each device's perspective
- What does the packet look like at each hop?

### 4. **Verify, Don't Assume**
- "The cable is fine" → Test it anyway
- "Configuration hasn't changed" → Check running vs startup config
- "This worked yesterday" → Verify current state

### 5. **Document as You Go**
- Don't rely on memory
- Include timestamps
- Note dead ends and eliminated causes
- Future you (or colleagues) will thank you

### 6. **Know When to Escalate**
- Hardware failure beyond your scope
- Security incident requiring specialized response
- Vendor support needed for proprietary features
- Change requires higher authorization

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

❌ **Random Configuration Changes**: "Let me just try changing this..."
✓ **Hypothesis-Driven Changes**: "Based on evidence X, I expect Y will fix it"

❌ **Ignoring Baselines**: "I don't know what it looked like before"
✓ **Compare to Known Good**: "This differs from our standard configuration"

❌ **Incomplete Testing**: "It works now, done!"
✓ **Comprehensive Verification**: "All original symptoms are resolved and stable"

❌ **No Documentation**: "I fixed it but don't remember how"
✓ **Complete Audit Trail**: "Here's exactly what was wrong and how I fixed it"

---

## Example Scenarios and Methodology Selection

| Scenario | Selected Methodology | Rationale |
|----------|---------------------|-----------|
| Users can't browse internet but can ping 8.8.8.8 | Top-Down | Network layer works, issue is DNS/HTTP |
| New router install has no connectivity | Bottom-Up | Likely physical/basic config issue |
| Remote site can't reach HQ database | Follow Traffic Path | Multi-hop WAN scenario |
| One switch configured differently than others | Compare Configurations | Reference device available |
| Unknown issue: "email is slow" | Divide and Conquer | Unclear layer, needs diagnosis |

---

## Integration with Change Management

Every resolution should feed back into organizational learning:

1. **Update documentation**: Network diagrams, runbooks, configuration standards
2. **Feed into change management**: Was this caused by a recent change?
3. **Update monitoring**: Add checks to catch this issue earlier next time
4. **Train team**: Share lessons learned in team meetings
5. **Refine processes**: Update procedures to prevent recurrence

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill whenever you encounter:

- Network connectivity issues
- Routing protocol problems  
- Configuration troubleshooting
- Performance degradation
- Service outages
- Post-change validation failures
- Inter-VLAN routing issues
- WAN connectivity problems
- ACL or firewall blocking
- Any situation requiring systematic network diagnosis

**Do NOT use** for:
- Initial network design (use design skills)
- Security hardening (use security skills)
- Capacity planning (use performance analysis skills)
- Routine monitoring (use monitoring skills)

This skill is specifically for **reactive troubleshooting** of existing network faults.

---

## Final Notes

This skill enforces **professional troubleshooting discipline**. It may feel slower than "just trying things," but it:

- Reduces mean time to repair (MTTR) overall
- Prevents introducing new problems
- Builds organizational knowledge
- Provides audit trails for compliance
- Trains junior engineers in best practices
- Reduces repeat incidents through lessons learned

**Remember**: In networking, discipline and documentation separate professionals from hobbyists.
